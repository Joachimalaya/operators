# Operators
Operators is a simple API, that allows you to add simple, consistent operator functions to your kotlin classes.

As kotlin allows operator overriding you can then use convenient operators in your code.

## Modifications
Operators ships with a usable example on how to use the OperatorHelper. In Modifications you can find a multiplication function for Lists.
